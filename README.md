## Core Architecture: The Powerhouse Within

At its heart, the bot features an elegant, agent-based architecture orchestrated by CrewAI, where specialized agents collaborate like a well-oiled machine:

*   **`MarketIntelligenceAgent` (The Analyst):** Scours data from diverse sources, uncovers market trends, gauges volatility, and deciphers market sentiment.
*   **`ReinforcementLearningAgent` (The Strategist):** The maestro of the RL model. It feeds the model current market observations and translates the model's strategic actions (buy/sell/hold) into directives.
*   **`TradingExecutionAgent` (The Operator):** Executes trades on Robinhood with precision and security, acting on the refined decisions from the RL agent and the collaborative insights of the crew.
*   **`OptimizationAgent` (The Refiner - conceptual):** This role, often embedded in CrewAI tasks, focuses on continuously sharpening strategies and parameters, potentially through backtesting or simulated environments.
*   **`ErrorMonitoringAgent` (The Guardian):** Vigilantly monitors the system, logging errors and contributing to unwavering stability and reliability.
*   **`CommunicationHub` (The Network - implicit in CrewAI):** Ensures fluid communication and seamless data exchange between all agents, making true collaboration possible.

## Prerequisites: What You'll Need to Get Started

*   Python 3.8+ (and a dash of curiosity!)
*   A Robinhood account with Crypto Trading enabled.
*   Your Robinhood Crypto API Key and Private Key (obtainable from the Robinhood API Credentials Portal - desktop browser needed).
*   Optionally, API keys for other data sources if you plan to use them extensively (e.g., a premium CoinGecko plan).

## Setup: Launching Your AI Trading Co-Pilot

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd robinhood-crypto-bot
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv  # Ensure python3 is used
    source .venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy the example environment file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   **Edit the `.env` file with your credentials and desired settings.** Refer to `.env.example` for a full list of configurable parameters, including:
        *   Robinhood API credentials (`ROBINHOOD_API_KEY`, `ROBINHOOD_BASE64_PRIVATE_KEY`)
        *   Trading parameters (`SYMBOLS_TO_TRADE`, `TRADE_AMOUNT_USD`, `ENABLE_TRADING`)
        *   AI model paths and settings (`RL_MODEL_PATH`, `ENABLE_RL_MODEL`)
        *   Data provider preferences and intervals.

    **Security Note:** Your `ROBINHOOD_PRIVATE_KEY` and other sensitive keys are critical. Ensure the `.env` file is **never** committed to version control (it's included in `.gitignore` by default).

## Running the Bot

```bash
python main.py # Or your main script, e.g., crypto_bot.py
```

The bot will initialize its agents, perform an initial analysis cycle, and then run scheduled cycles. View logs and plots as configured.

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the bot gracefully.

## Testing

The project uses `pytest` for running automated tests. Ensure you have test-specific configurations if needed (e.g., in a test environment file or separate test configs).

To run tests:
```bash
pytest -vv
```

## Development

*   **Adding Trading Strategies:** Beyond traditional indicators, new strategies can involve modifying the RL agent's reward function, state representation, or action space, or by developing new tools/tasks for the CrewAI agents.
*   **Modifying AI Agents:** Adjust prompts, tools, or tasks for CrewAI agents in their respective configuration or source files.
*   **Data Providers:** Integrate new data sources by creating new provider classes and updating the relevant agents or configuration.

## Important Considerations

*   **API Rate Limits:** The Robinhood API has rate limits. If you run the bot too frequently (low `CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES`), you might encounter errors.
*   **Market Orders:** The bot currently uses market orders, which can be subject to slippage (execution price differing from the expected price). Consider implementing limit orders for more price control.
*   **Error Handling:** While basic error handling is included, robust error handling for network issues, API errors, and unexpected data is crucial for a reliable trading bot.
*   **Testing:** **Thoroughly test** the bot in analysis-only mode (`ENABLE_TRADING=false`) before enabling live trading.
*   **Security:** Protect your API keys and `.env` file diligently.
